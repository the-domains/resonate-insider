# Mobile platform...why?

We were recently asked to help a client choose a mobile platform.  We have been advising and delivering solutions to this client for a while.  They are an enterprise level company and have been considering a mobile strategy for some time.

Initial reservations from the Resonate IT team were centred around the longevity of mobile platforms as a whole given the advances in technologies such as HTML5, AngularJS and browser standards.  Surely in 2016 there is no real reason to consider the kind of outlay required to adopt, license and deliver solution on a platform.  We asked ourselves - "is this the epitome of tying your life raft to a sinking ship?".   We were however more than willing to have that opinion challenged and changed.

Some of the questions we had and expected to deliver opinion changing answers were:

* Why choose a mobile platform over pure HTML5?
* Does the platform deliver inherent offline capabilities without needing development?
* Does the platform deliver synchronisation without needing development?
* Does the platform automatically provision apps that work across devices, OS, browsers?

In each case the answers did nothing but cement that HTML5 offered a more standard and effective solution to the problem.  One answer in particular stood out - Q) Why choose your platform over HTML5? A) So that the mobile app will work across all devices!  Surely this is an argument that plays directly into the hands of the HTML5 approach!

Anyway not wanting to be too one-sided in the. We then researched a little on what the market was saying on the subject.  Whist there are vehemently opposing arguments we did find a site that whilst obviously bias to the mobile platform (native app) approach had put together a reasonable argument (even if we don't share the opinion!) - [Native vs Web vs HTML5][0]
