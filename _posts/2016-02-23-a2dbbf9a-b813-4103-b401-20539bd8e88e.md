Making SharePoint a truly adaptive, responsive interface is no simple task.  

Firstly, we need to decide if getting a full mobile experience out of SharePoint is a worthwhile endeavor.  Should we invest out time (and the client money) to develop a mobility framework within SharePoint that will actually work.  In some cases the answer is yeah OK that makes sense but when the style of the application is important and specifically the mobile / device rendering of that style is highly important the challenges definitely outweigh the wins.

Secondly, how tied to SharePoint is the application?  Do we rely heavily on the SharePoint platform to deliver large parts of the application?  If so then we might reconsider the above.  If not, then what are our best options.

The one resounding success we've had here at Resonate IT is our mix of SharePoint and AngujarJS - we've named this approach our **Shangular **not only because it sounds like like an earthly paradise (see [Shangri-La][0]) and we love spending time there!

This has become somewhat of a framework for us lately.  In very basic terms we utilise the underlying platform SharePoint provides to take advantage of simple data structures, authentication, workflow and similar whilst we build the application itself using the ultra-modern AngularJS framework.  We generally host these pages in the SharePoint 'hive' (\_layouts/app).

So far this technique has helped us deliver a number of very successful enterprise applications in a way that clearly differentiates us from the competition.  The projects include:

* Customer Relationship Management

* Membership and Property Portfolio Management

* Safety Assessments

Here's a little taster of one of our latest successes:
